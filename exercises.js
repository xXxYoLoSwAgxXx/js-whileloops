//while loops

/*If you do not know how many times the code should run, using a while loop can help. Your code in the while loop will continue to run for as long as the condition is true.*/


//example:

/*var i = 5;

while (i<10){	
	console.log(i + " is next in line.");
}*/

//this while loop will continue to run since 5 will always meet the condition inside of the while loop ( 5 < 10);

//Let's practice using some while loops.


/*1. Use a while loop to create the following message:

"Now serving 1."
"Now serving 2."
...
...
...
"Now serving 11"*/





/*2. Generate a multiplication table for the number 3 and print out the following:

1 x 3 = 3
2 x 3 = 6
3 x 3 = 9
...
...
...
9 x 3 = 27

*/



/*3. Multiples of 3 and 5. Create a while loop that will loop through 100 numbers. Your job is to program the following:

 a) if the number is multiple of 3, it should print "dev"
 b) if the number is a multiple of 5, it should print "league"
 c) if the number is a multiple of 3 and 5, it should print "devleague homie!"
 d) if the number is neither a multiple of 3 and 5, it should print the number

the print out should look like this:
1
2
dev
4
league
dev
7
8
dev
league
11
dev
13
14
devleague homie!
...
